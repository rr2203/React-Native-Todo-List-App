A simple todo list app built with React Native. Users can add tasks, delete tasks, and mark tasks as complete. The app features a clean and user-friendly interface.

```

2. Install dependencies:
```
cd todo-list-app-react-native && npm install
```

3. Run the app:
```
npm start
```

## Usage
1. Click on the "Add New Task" button to add a new task.
2. Type the task in the input field and click on the "Add Task" button.
3. To delete a task, press and hold the task item and release to confirm deletion.
4. To mark a task as complete, simply tap on the task item.

## Further Improvemnts: 
The Apps look slightly different on android and IOS because of different underlying native code compilations of the common react native code. For a similar experience on both platforms we could incorporate native elements into the code.
